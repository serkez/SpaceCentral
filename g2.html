            <p>The Rossete Nebula is named after its rose-like shape. Inside the nebula, there is a clustervof young stars called NGC 2244. Stelar winds from these stars are creating a hole in the nebula's center, and UV light from the cluster causes the nebula to glow. The nebula and star cluster lie at a distance of 5,000 light years from Earth and the nebula is roughly 130 light years in diameter.The Rosette Nebula became the official state astronomical object of Oklahoma in 2019.</p>

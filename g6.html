            <p>This image was the first picture taken of a black hole. The image shows the shadow of a massive black hole located in the center of Messier 87, a galaxy that is around 55 million light-years away from Earth. This black hole is 6.5 billion times the mass of our sun. To capture this image, eight ground-based radio telescopes worked together around the world to make history. </p>

        <p>This one of the more detailed images of Earth. This Blue Marble Earth montage was created from photographs taken by the Visible/Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument on board the Suomi NPP satellite. The image shows many stunning details of our home planet. The composite was created from the data collected during four orbits of the robotic satellite and digitally projected onto the globe. Many features of North America and the Western Hemisphere are particularly visible on a high resolution version of the image.

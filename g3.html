            <p>The Helix nebula is often photographed for its vivid colors and resemblance to a ginat eye. This infrared image from NASA Spitzer Space Telescope shows the Helix nebula. The Helix nebula is located in the constellation Aquarius and is relativly close to Earth; only 650 light-years away. The Helix nebula is a planetary nebula, meaning it is a nebula formed by the emission of gas from a red giant star near the end of its evolution. It was discovered by Karl Ludwig Harding before 1824. The Helix nebula is sometimes reffered to as the "Eye of God." </p>
